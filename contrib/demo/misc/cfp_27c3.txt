Do you have a zombie infestation plan? Have you practiced running from
your friends and family, arming yourself against rotting hordes, and
avoiding infection by decapitating the ones you love? In the event of
your own infection, have you considered turning against your former
allies in the search of delicious brains and a high score? Good news,
everyone!

The ZombieGotcha lets you do all these things and more, powered by an
8051 MCU and 900MHz radio.  Clever abuse of a text-mode LCD allows for
exciting pixel art, while over-the-air updates allow the rules of the
game to be changed each time it is played.  A dozen or more players
begin as humans, then an infection is launched among the crowd from a
single, chosen patient-zero.

The game itself is being prototyped on the GirlTech IMME, an instant
messaging toy for children that can be re-flashed a GoodFET or
Arduino.  The firmware is compiled with the free Small Device C
Compiler, and sprites are translated from bitmap sources using custom
Perl scripts.  When complete, this project is targeting custom
hardware suitable for use as an electronic conference badge.

Is your zombie one armed, one legged, or just a torso?  Is it fresh,
rotten or an in between?  The ZombieGotcha is one-size-fits-all!
