Howdy y'all,

The ZombieGotcha is to be a handheld, multiplayer game for the
GirlTech IMME or custom hardware.  It began as a conversation between
Eli Skipp, Jordan Bunker, Jeff Kantarek, and Joshua Krueger.  Travis
Goodspeed and Eli Skipp begin implementation in Knoxville, TN on 5
August 2010.

This is a release of the source code to the demo, which was previewed
as a binary blob in my article, Bitmapped Sprites on the GirlTech
IMME.  I was hoping to have the game finished by the 27th Chaos
Communications Congress, but I am unable to continue development for
personal reasons.

As far as licensing goes, I'll just recite Cory Doctorow's favorite
quotation of Woody Guthrie:

	  This song is Copyrighted in U.S., under Seal of Copyright
	  #154085, for period of 28 years, and anybody caught singin'
	  it without our permission, will be mighty good friends of
	  ourn, cause we don't give a dern.  Publish it.  Write it.
	  Swing to it.  Yodel it.  We wrote it, that's all we wanted
	  to do.

I sincerely hope that some good neighbors replace me as the developer
for this project, and that the result is a brilliant success.  Do not
feel the need to ask me for permission to extend, change, rip apart,
replace, gut, re-factor, or otherwise change anything.

Happy hacking,
--Travis Goodspeed
